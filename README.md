# Number One Fan

The idea is to make it easy to follow somebody across all social media platforms. Could be expressed as a web or mobile app. Key features:

## Account Creation

User can create an account & identify his desired social media platforms. EVEN BETTER: Create an account WITH a social media account & indicate desired accounts by connecting them.

## Target Designation

User drops a link to a social media account of interest.

## The Payoff

Easy: 

* App parses the provided social media profile & extracts any additional social media links.
* Process recurses until it has a complete list.
* App presents the list to the user and he clicks through & follows.

Better: If the user's social media accounts are arrached with appropriate permissions, app creates the follows on the user's behalf.

Probably don't just want to follow without some kind of confirmation because a profile could easily mention somebody else's profile. Don't want to wind up following the whole world.

## Extras

* You could watch a set of profiles & follow whover they follow.
* You could automatically follow new platforms for a given target.
